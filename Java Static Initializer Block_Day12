DAY 12
Topic: Java Static Initializer Block 
A Static Initialization Block in Java is a block that runs before the main( ) method in Java. 
Java does not care if this block is written after the main( ) method or before the main( ) method, it will be executed before the main method( ) regardless.
In simpler language whenever we use a static keyword and associate it to a block then that block is referred to as a static block. 
Unlike C++, Java supports a special block, called a static block (also called static clause) that can be used for static initialization of a class. 
This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory.
