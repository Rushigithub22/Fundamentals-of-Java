string-reverse
Following are some interesting facts about String and StringBuilder classes : 

Objects of String are immutable. 
String class in Java does not have reverse() method, however, the StringBuilder class has built-in reverse() method. 
StringBuilder class do not have toCharArray() method, while String class does have toCharArray() method. 
1. The idea is to traverse the length of the string 
2. Extract each character while traversing 
3. Add each character in front of the existing string

Converting String into Bytes: getBytes() method is used to convert the input string into bytes[]. 
Method:  

1. Create a temporary byte[]  of length equal 
   to the length of the input string.
2. Store the bytes (which we get by using 
   getBytes() method) in reverse order into 
   the temporary byte[] .
3. Create a new String abject using byte[] to
   store result.
