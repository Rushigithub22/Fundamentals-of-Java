End Of File is the special data or delimiter which will set the end of file for a specific file. 
This file contains different types of data from text to image but the end of the file is the same for all of them. 
End Of File can be also expressed as EOF in a short form. EOF is also used in different programming languages in order to express and check the end of the file.
Checking the end of the file is important especially developing applications. 
While reading a file to process, print or view we need to check the end of file in some cases especially in low-level operations.
Java programming language provides different functions in order to read, write files. 
In Java when a file is read the value generally stored in a variable like a String. If the end of the file is reached the returned value will be a null which is simply nothing.
We can check the end of the file if the returned value is null like below.
