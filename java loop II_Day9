java Loops II
The for-each loop is used to traverse array or collection in Java. It is easier to use than simple for loop because we don't need to increment value and use subscript notation.

It works on the basis of elements and not the index. It returns element one by one in the defined variable.

Java Nested for Loop

If we have a for loop inside the another loop, it is known as nested for loop. The inner loop executes completely whenever outer loop executes.

Question: You are given  queries in the form of , q , and . For each query, print the series corresponding to the given ,a ,b and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective ai, bi, and ni values for that query.

Constraints

0 <= q <= 500
0 <= a,b <= 50
1 <= n <= 15

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Sample Input:

2
0 2 10
5 3 5

Sample Output:

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
